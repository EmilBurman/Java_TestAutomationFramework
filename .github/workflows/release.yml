    # Bumping
    # Manual Bumping: Any commit message that includes
    #  - #major,
    #  - #minor
    #  - #patch
    # will trigger the respective version bump.
    # If two or more are present, the highest-ranking one will take precedence.
    # Automatic Bumping:
    # - If no #major, #minor or #patch tag is contained in the commit messages,
    # it will bump whichever DEFAULT_BUMP is set to (which is minor by default).
